This guide represents about 40 hours of labor involving me learning the basics of Apache and mod-wsgi. I am forever grateful to all the sources on the Internet that made this possible without which I could not have done this. I will link to them at the bottom of this documents.

Lets start off with a basic 'hello world' config which will be based mostly off of.

We are following the wonderful tutorial acomponied by vidoe series by:
Manuel Amunategui
	http://amunategui.github.io/idea-to-pitch/
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HuYr6G2Z28&list=UUq4pm1i_VZqxKVVOz5qRBIA&index=1

First I recommend following his configuration guidelines for your ec2 instance to the t. 

Once you ssh in I will put the rest of the configure stuff here so that we have a continues flow.

Install your Apache web server:
	sudo apt-get install apache2
	sudo apt-get update

Install the mod-wsgi:
	sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
	a2enmod wsgi

Install Pip3 (pip3 means that it will install only python 3.x packages which is the whole point of this tutorial):
	sudo apt install python3-pip

Install virtualenv
	pip3 install virtualenv

Now navigate to the desired directory for your virtual environment:
I choose to put it in my home/ubuntu directory so I go:
	cd /home/ubuntu

Create the enviorment with the command:
	virtualenv -p python3 ./venv3 

Now we have created an environment with the name venv3. We will use this to install flask later for now lets just take note of the path to it
PATH_TO_VIRTUL_ENV = /home/ubuntu

Now this is where things get all server side and I get confused we are curently following an amagimation of 3 set up guides on how to do this so I cant give you much why just check out the links at the bottom if you want to try and reason your way to a why

So now we activate our virtual envorment to install the wsgi script:
source ./venv3/bin/activate

Your command prompt should look something like (venv3) ubuntu@ip-11-1-1-111:~$ 

now we need to run:
	sudo apt-get install apache2-dev
this gets us the correct header files which is cool I guess

then we install mod_wsgi
	pip install mod_wsgi

Next run:
	sudo venv3/bin/mod_wsgi-express install-module
This should return something like this:
	LoadModule wsgi_module "/usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_wsgi-py35.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so"
	WSGIPythonHome "/home/ubuntu/venv3"
I would save these as we will need them soon. I am fairly certain that what we have done is told mod_wsgi where we want our python interpeter to be. ive read on the interent the reason for this is that python does something wacky with ASCII or UNICODE encodiengs and so it need to be specally compiled for wsgi IDK on that though. 

Next were going to tell it where to run so we need to modify a file so run

sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-available/wsgi_express.{load,conf}

and paste in the lines we got from running sudo venv3/bin/mod_wsgi-express install-module
Note if it loads you into a different file paste the lines into that one as well #possible place to fail 

next exit and save you might get told your saving to a different file as long as it saves it has worked ok

Finally enable the module and check Apache's error log:
	a2enmod wsgi
	sudo service apache2 restart
	less /var/log/apache2/error.log

now back to simple stuff deactive the virtual enviorment:
deactivate 

Now move to the www sounds like it has to do with web stuff so lets put our app here
	cd /var/www
	sudo mkdir flask-app
	cd flask-app
	sudo mkdir helloworld-app
	cd helloworld-app

now we will make to files a run.py and a requirements.txt
	sudo nano /var/www/flask-app/helloworld-app/run.py
	In this file put the following:

import nltk
from flask import Flask
app=Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return  "This is from Flask on EC2 running in a virtual envirment"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

	sudo nano /var/www/flask-app/helloworld-app/requirments.txt
	In this file we place the programs requirments in this case we install flask and nltk to make sure other librays work aswell as flask once installed. (I have seen numorous other turorials that simply just use a work around to get flask working)

Flask==0.11.1
nltk==3.2.1

Now lets install the requirments:

1. Activate virtual enviroment
	source /home/ubuntu/venv3/bin/activate
2. install requirments.txt
	pip install -r requirments.txt

Now deactivate the enviorment:
deactivate 

Now lets configure our appache server:

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/helloworld-app.conf

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName PUT YOUR SERVER IP HERE
    ServerAdmin admin@mywebsite.com 
    WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/flask-app/app.wsgi
    WSGIDaemonProcess flaskProcess
    <Location /flask>
	    WSGIProcessGroup flaskProcess
	    WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
	    Require all granted
	</Location>
    <Directory /var/www/flask-app/helloworld-app/>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
    <Directory /var/www/FlaskApps/flask-app/helloworld-app/static/>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    LogLevel warn
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

now lets restrart the server
	sudo service apache2 reload

next enable the site
	sudo a2ensite helloworld-app
	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

Now lets configure the web server gate interface:
sudo nano /var/www/flask-app/app.wsgi

import os, sys

PROJECT_DIR = '/var/www/flask-app/helloworld-app'
VIRTUAL_ENV = "/home/ubuntu"
sys.path.insert(0, PROJECT_DIR)


def execfile(filename):
    globals = dict( __file__ = filename )
    exec( open(filename).read(), globals )

activate_this = os.path.join( VIRTUAL_ENV, 'venv3/bin', 'activate_this.py' )
execfile( activate_this )

# run points to the home.py file
from run import app as application
application.secret_key = "somesecretsessionkey"


run some last reloads
sudo service apache2 restart
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload 

And go to your servers IP in browser to check that your example site works if it does you should see

This is from Flask on EC2 running in a virtual envirment

WOW were home free we did it guys!!!
